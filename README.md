# RPG-Style-Game
This is a GameMaker Studio 2 project. The project uses a 2D 16-bit pixel art style and is set in a generic fantasy style world. This project was originally built on the GameMaker ARPG tutorial series by Shaun Spalding. The assests used in this project were either custom made or licenced from sellers on Itch.io. A full list of sources for the assests will be provided in the section below.

This project was meant to be a chance for me to take a deeper dive into GameMaker, GML and game development methodlogies in general. I had previously made some small projects in GameMaker, but I was afraid to take them too much further out of fear of developing something incorrectly. That's where Shaun Spaulding's tutorial series came in. He provided a very in depth tutorial on not only how to use the many features provided by GameMaker and GML, but also how to properly implement features so that they are scalable and robust. After completing his series, I became a lot more confident to at least <i>try</i> to make a larger scale project.

I have commited to myself that I would continue to make at least 1 commit to this repository a day, regardless how small the change may be. I hope to continue adding to this project bit by bit and end up with something that I can be proud of many years down the line.
